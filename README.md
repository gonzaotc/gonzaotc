Hello!
I'm a front-end developer at Valtech and Software Engineering student in Argentina.<br/>
My main tech skills are Next.js, React.js, Tailwind, SASS, vanilla JS and CSS.<br/>

I'm into web3, books, lifting and going to new caffees in the city.<br/>
I have to comeback to guitar some day, but i'm spending most of my free time learning web3. <br/>

Currently learning:<br/>
TypeScript to improve my code realiability, Solidity to do some cool decentralized shet and ethers.js to interact with my frontends.
