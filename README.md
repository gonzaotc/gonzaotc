Hello dear traveler, <br/>
You just stepped into a passionate front-end and dapp developer profile.

I will tell you a bit more about me. <br/><br/>
I believe in technology as a tool to solve real people's problems, and I think that blockchains and decentralization are the way to fight towards a better and fairer future, with more financial inclusion and where everyone would be able to make free use of their finances.

I'm currently working as a front-end developer at Valtech in a large payment and billing management system mainly with Next.js, React.js, Redux, and Styled Components. 

I'm a Devcon VI Scholar, granted by and studying with the Ethereum Foundation, and I'm finishing the Ethereum Developer Program. Hope to meet you in Devcon!

I like to spend my free time learning about blockchain, financial inclusion & crypto adoption, and practicing Smart Contracts development with Solidity, Ethers.js, Hardhat, and TypeScript to contribute to the web3 ecosystem.

Currently learning and focusing: <br/>
The front-end is my stronger side, so now I'm learning to write better Smart Contracts with Solidity, test them and apply good practices. Also polishing user experiences through the interfaces, trying to make them easier, which I think that is super important if we want to onboard millions of users to web3 products.

Talking about Dapp engineering, I also like to use Web3.js, Ethers.js, web3-react, Wagmi.sh, Open Zeppelin contracts, Chainlink services and now I'm practicing with The Graph. 

I'm practicing through side-projects and applying to web3 hackathons. I and my team just won an Alchemy hackathon and the Media Party hackathon in 2022 :).

I'm looking to break into the web3 industry, so if you want to know more about me, or think that we could be a good match, you have all my contact info at  https://gonzaotc.com/.<br/>
<br/>
See you soon!
