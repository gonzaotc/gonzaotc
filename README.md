## :zap: About me<br/>

:mortar_board: I'm Gonzalo Othacehe, a passionate **Full-stack Web3 Developer** (specialized in **Front End Development** within the React and Next.js ecosystem), but I also like to do **Smart Contracts development**.  

:briefcase: I work as a **Front-end Developer** at ***Valtech***, currently finishing the development of a large payment and billing management system for a big client, mainly with Next.js, React.js, Redux, and Styled Components. 

:cyclone: **Vision**:  I believe in technology as a tool to solve real people's problems, and I see blockchain and decentralization as the way to strive towards a better and fairer future, **empowering individuals** over their finances and ownership of their data.

:books: I like to spend my free time learning and reading about blockchain, financial inclusion, crypto adoption, philosophy, non-fiction and fantasy, and practicing Smart Contracts development in side-projects and hackathons. 
Also, I like going out of the cave to enjoy nature, doing sports and meeting friends ;) .
