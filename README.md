Hello! <br/>
I'm a front-end developer at Valtech and Software Engineering student in Argentina.<br/>
My main tech skills are Next.js, React.js, Tailwind, SASS, vanilla JS and vanilla CSS.<br/>


I'm into web3, books, lifting and going to new caffees in the city.<br/>
I have to comeback to playing guitar some day, but i'm spending most of my free time learning web3. <br/>

Currently learning:<br/>
Solidity to do some cool decentralized projects, ethers.js to interact with my frontends and TypeScript to improve my code realiability.

I'm working with Valtech at a big payment system for hundreds of pharmacys in the region. (Next.js, Styled Components, Storybook, Docker, AWS)

Side projects that i'm currently working on:<br/>
- Chainz Network: Minecraft Server with NFT's and tokens. Using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Ethers.js, Rainbowkit & wagmi.
- Smart Coffee shop: Small app deployed on the polygon blockchain to gift coffees and store + display messages. Using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Ethers.js, MetaMask, Solidity & Open Zepellin Contracts.
