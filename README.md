## :zap: About me<br/>

:mortar_board: I'm Gonzalo Othacehe, a passionate **Full-stack Web3 Developer** (specialized in **Front End Development** within the React and Next.js ecosystem), but I also like to do **Smart Contracts development** with Solidity.  

:briefcase: I work as a **Front-end Developer** at ***Valtech***, currently finishing the development of a large payment and billing management system for a big client, mainly with Next.js, React.js, Redux, and Styled Components. 

:cyclone: **Vision**:  I believe in technology as a tool to solve real people's problems, and I see blockchain and decentralization as the way to strive towards a better and fairer future, **empowering individuals** over their finances and ownership of their data.

:books: I like to spend my free time **learning and reading** about blockchain, financial inclusion, crypto adoption, philosophy, non-fiction and fantasy, and **practicing** Smart Contracts development in side-projects and hackathons. 
Also, I like going out of the cave to enjoy nature, do sports and meet friends ;) .

## :dart: Currently working on

* :milky_way: [Concensys Blockchain Bootcamp](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/)

* :scroll: [C4's Certified Ethereum Professional (CEP) certification](https://cryptoconsortium.org/certifications/cep/) 

* :hammer_and_wrench: :fire: As **the Front-end is my stronger side**, I'm learning to **write better Smart Contracts** to have a better over-all understanding of the **Web3 architecture**, testing them and applying good practices. Also **polishing user experiences**, trying to make them easier, which I consider unavoidable if we want to be able to onboard the next billion users to our industry.
