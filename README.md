Hello dear traveler!, <br/>
You just stepped into a passionate front-end and web3 full-stack developer profile.

I will tell you a bit more about me. <br/>
I believe in technology as a tool to solve real people's problems, and I think that blockchains and decentralization are the way to fight towards a better future, fairer, with more financial inclusion and where everyone would be able to make free use of their finances.

I'm currently working as a front-end developer at Valtech in a large payment and billing management system mainly with Next.js, React.js, Redux, and Styled Components. (Unfortunately, I can't show you the code bc it's private and secured in BitBucket).

I like to spend my free time learning about blockchain, financial inclusion & crypto adoption, and practicing Smart Contracts development with Solidity, Ethers.js, Hardhat, and TypeScript to contribute to the web3 ecosystem.

I'm into web3, books, music, lifting, philosophy, and going to new coffees in the city.
I have to come back to playing guitar someday, but I'm spending most of my time learning web3.

Currently learning and focusing: <br/>
The front-end is my stronger side, so I'm learning to write better Smart Contracts, test them and apply good practices. Also 
polishing user experiences through the interfaces, trying to make them easier, which I think that's super important if we want to onboard millions of users to web3 products.

I'm practicing through side-projects and applying to web3 hackatons. My team just won an Alchemy hackaton! :) .


I'm looking to break into the web3 industry, so if you want to know more about me, or think that we could be a good match, meet me at https://gonzaotc.com/.
