## :zap: About me

:mortar_board: I'm a passionate **Full-stack (React/Solidity) Web3 Developer** with my core being the frontend within the React ecosystem, but I also enjoy Smart Contract Development, blockchain integrations, and playing around with new tech. I am also pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science & Engineering at the National University of Mar del Plata.

:briefcase: I currently work full-time as a Full-stack Web3 Developer at [***SpaceDev***](https://spacedev.io), and lead Frontend Engineer & Blockchain Integrations at [***Acme***](https://acme.am)

:cyclone: **Vision**: I believe in technology as a tool to solve real people's problems, and I envision blockchain and decentralization as the way to strive toward a better and fairer future, empowering individuals over their finances and ownership of their data and digital assets.

:books: I like to spend my free time learning and reading about blockchain, philosophy, non-fiction, and fantasy, and practicing Smart Contracts development in side projects and hackathons. Also, I like going out of the cave to enjoy nature, do sports meet friends, and take a lot of sips from lattes.
