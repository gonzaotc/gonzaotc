Hello!
I'm a front-end developer at Valtech and Software Engineering student in Argentina.
My main tech skills are Next.js, React.js, Tailwind, SASS, vanilla JS and CSS.
I'm into web3, books, lifting and going to new caffees in the city, I have to comeback to guitar some day, but i'm spending most of my free time learning web3. 

Currently learning TypeScript to improve my code realiability, Solidity to do some decentralized shet and ethers.js to interact with my frontends.
